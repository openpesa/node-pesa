## What is Pesa SDK

Pesa SDK is a [Software Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) - a toolkit - for people are looking to inrtgrate payments into apps built with Javascript.

## Goal

Openpesa 2 is born to be compassionately accessible to your payment gateways.

To enable you to integrate Payments OpenAPI much ⚡️ faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of functions for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries.

> Pesa SDK lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

## Who is Pesa SDK For?

Pesa SDK is right for you if:

-   You want to integrate OpenAPI with a small footprint.
-   You want a library that requires nearly zero configuration.
-   You want a library that does not require you to use the command line.
-   You are not interested in large-scale monolithic libraries like PEAR.
-   You eschew complexity, favoring simple solutions.
-   You need clear, thorough documentation.

Where possible, Pesa SDK has been kept as flexible as possible, allowing you to work in the way you want, not being forced into working any certain way. The library can have core parts easily extended or completely replaced to make the system work the way you need it to. In short, Pesa SDK is the malleable framework that tries to provide the tools you need while staying out of the way.
